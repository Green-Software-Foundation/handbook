# Decision Making

Note:


```
Working Group Charter - 3. Working Group Decision Making
3.1. Consensus/Voting/Approval.
The Working Group will endeavor to make all decisions by consensus.  
Where the Working Group cannot reach consensus with respect to a particular decision, the Working Group will make that decision by a Supermajority Vote of the Steering Members and General Members in this Working Group. 
3.2. Appeals. 
Working Group decisions may be appealed by issuing a written appeal to the Working Group Chair, and that appeal will be considered by the Working Group chair in good faith.  
The Working Group Chair will respond in writing within a reasonable time.
3.3 Notifications and Electronic Voting.  
The Working Group Chair is responsible for issuing all notifications of meetings and votes of the Working Group subject to the following minimum criteria: 
(i) in-person meetings require at least 30 days prior written notice, 
(ii) teleconference meetings require at least 7 days prior written notice (this requirement only applies to the notification of the first meeting of automatically recurring teleconference meetings), 
(iii) electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only "yes" and "no" options, and the voting must remain open for no less than 7 days.  These notification requirements with respect to the Project may be overridden upon unanimous consent of all Steering Members and General Members that have attended and participated in at least 50% of the last 4 meetings of the Project.

As part of their responsibilities defined in [Roles & Responsibilities](#heading=h.u6wogeqyf3y7), WG chairs and officers need to ensure efficient and effective decision-making.



* The decision-making process in WGs is intended to be as inclusive as possible.
* WGs shall attempt to use consensus to make decisions.
* If consensus cannot be reached, voting mechanisms MAY be used.
* Formal notice SHALL be given for decision making, e.g.:
    * Inclusion of a document on the agenda, proposing a specific decision to be taken (e.g. Pull Request).
    * Inclusion of an item directly in the agenda (e.g. proposed next meeting date).
    * Items proposed for Approval via the group mailing list (e.g. agreement a document revision).
    * Inclusion of a document for decision in an electronic Review, Comment and Approval event
    * Inclusion of a document for decision in an e-vote (Supermajority) vote.

The above list is not exhaustive.



* There SHALL be no distinction in the decision-making merit of real-time or non-real-time meetings.
    * In real-time meetings, consensus can be determined by receiving no sustained objections to a proposal.
    * In non-real-time meetings, consensus SHOULD be developed using Review, Comment and Agreement periods, e.g. using Review and Approval
* Proposals SHALL be available for a given period.


## Seeking Consensus



* Groups shall endeavour to reach a consensus on all decisions.
* Informal methods of reaching consensus are encouraged (e.g. a show of hands).
* Groups SHOULD attempt to ensure contributions relating to the same subject matter are considered together before being disposed of.
* However, the Chair SHALL ensure that unavailable contributions or participants do not delay progress.
* Agreement SHALL be sought in all forms of meeting.


## Handling objections when seeking consensus



* Objections from a small minority SHOULD be minuted, and the objecting delegates SHOULD be questioned if having their objections minuted is sufficient, and they agree not to sustain their objections.
    * If such agreements are secured, then there is a consensus for approving the proposal.
    * If such agreements are not secured, then the proposal is not agreed, and further action SHALL be taken (e.g. the proposal is withdrawn, updated, or voted on).
    * Members are discouraged from sustaining their objections when it is clear that a vote would overrule them was one to take place.
* In real-time meetings, consensus can be determined by receiving no sustained objections to a proposal.
    * Efforts to immediately resolve or record objections can be taken to attempt to achieve consensus.
* Where attendance is sparse when viewed from normal participation levels, potentially controversial proposals SHOULD be made available to the broader membership.
* The Chair is responsible for ensuring such an opportunity for participation in the decision-making process.
* Sparsely attended meetings SHOULD NOT be used to drive through proposals that would not have broad support.
* Following a decision-making meeting, a summary of decisions and document dispositions SHALL be published as soon as is practical.
    * This will be addressed if the meeting minutes are available in a timely fashion.
* When there is insufficient time for review in a real-time meeting, non-real-time consensus approaches SHOULD be considered.
* In non-real-time meetings, consensus SHOULD be developed by using Review and Approval periods.
* Proposals SHALL be available for a given period.


# Using Supermajority vote to achieve agreement


## Phrasing of Voting Questions



* The Chair ensures that questions to be voted upon SHALL be phrased concisely and unambiguously.
* Questions SHOULD NOT be phrased as "The group SHALL not do xyz". Examples of appropriate questions are:
    * SHALL the Group agree on the Specification?
    * SHALL the liaison be approved?
    * SHALL the new Work Package be approved?
    * SHALL the existing Work Package be stopped?
    * If the issue is to choose between two options (i.e. A or B), an example of the appropriate question may be:
    * SHALL the Group agree on Option A or Option B?
* The option of receiving no less than 3/4 of the Supermajority Votes SHALL be the Group's decision.
* If the issue is to choose between three or more options, the Group SHOULD use informal voting to reduce the number of options to two, and then use formal voting, if necessary.


## Voting on Technical Issues


## Note: Supermajority Vote - 1 Member Organisation represents 1 Vote



* Before voting, a clear definition of the issuer SHALL be provided by the Chair.
* Members eligible to vote SHALL only be entitled to one vote each.
* Each member MAY cast its vote as often as it wishes, and the last vote it casts counts.
* Voting MAY be performed electronically.
* Voting MAY be performed by showing hands and members announcing their vote verbally one by one, or paper ballots.
* The result of the vote SHALL be recorded in the meeting minutes.
* Groups MAY use informal voting to reach consensus. If the Group is still unable to reach a consensus, then a formal vote MAY be taken.
* Each member's electronic vote SHALL be electronically acknowledged to confirm participation in the vote.
* The voting period for proposals are:
    * In-person-meetings require at least 30 days prior written notice
    * Teleconference meetings require at least 7 days prior written notice
    * Electronic voting MUST remain open for no less than 7 days.


## Note: electronic votes require no advance notice but must be made pursuant to a clear and unambiguous ballot with only “yes” and “no” options, and the voting must remain open for no less than 7 days. These notification requirements with respect to the Project may be overridden upon unanimous consent of all Steering Members and General Members that have attended and participated in at least 50% of the last 4 meetings of the Project.
