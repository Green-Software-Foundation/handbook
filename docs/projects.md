# Projects

GSF will achieve its mission through projects supported by individual GSF members and resourced by the GSF itself.

If a set of individual members believes in a project, can gather support from others and reach consensus approval of a Working Group, then the GSF will allocate resources to support and help deliver that project.

Each GSF Project belongs to one of the GSF's Working Groups and must follow the Patent/IP and Copyright agreement of that working group as laid out in the GSF Membership agreement. **NOTE:** If the GSF Working Group has NOT specified a Patent/IP or Copyright agreement then the GSF Project is free to choose it's own.

## Minimum Project Requirements

Every officially supported project in the GSF MUST have:

### PR FAQ

A dummy press release and an FAQ in one document, see [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/136xvPYxd98qt_G0c0W2TnNE_ZRb5fDrVWIJRRuCUQSk/edit?usp=sharing) as an example. This document tells someone what a project is about, what problem it's solving and how, who the stakeholders and end users are. When communicating the project to others the PR FAQ is the first document you should send to give people an overview of the project.

### Milestones

Milestones with dates recorded in a Monday.com board. We know when projects are healthy when they are hitting milestones, we know when projects need help when they are slipping milestones.

### Project Web Site

A single document with information about who is working on the project, how the project will be run and where the project assets are located. You should be able to find every other relevant document, tool or location related to the project from this one doc.

### Email Communication Lists

The main form of communication for every project is an email list provided by Google groups. Email is the most common form of communication which every member of the foundation shares and is allowed by all members as a communication tool. Each project has two mail lists:

* **p-&lt;name>**: Contains everyone, this list is visible to all gsf members but not to the public, members can see the historical messages via Google groups page. 
* **p-&lt;name>-lt**: Contains just the project PM and the lead contributor, this is the leadership team for the project. This list is **not** visible to all gsf members.

### Scheduled Reviews

Projects are reviewed internally in the GSF in Weekly and more in depth Quarterly reviews and by the membership of the Foundation Working Group calls.

## Project Team

For a project to be a success it needs to be well managed, have a strong leadership team and members who are able to put time towards it. A GSF Project has a prescribed structure which recognizes the different levels of time commitment people can put towards a project.

A GSF project has:

* **PM** - Owns the project and is ultimately responsible for the project delivering against its milestones.
* **Lead Contributor**
  * There is only one lead contributor, usually the person who initiated the project, subject matter expert, the face of the project in discussions.
  * Works closely with the PM.
  * Elected every 3 months by the other contributors.
  * Lead contributor does not have to be a principal.
* **Principal Contributors**
  * Primary contributors willing to spare at least **4hrs per week** working on tasks **assigned by the PM.**
* **Contributors**
  * Actively contribute **2hrs a week** to the project working on tasks **assigned by the PM**.
* **Advisers**
  * Contributors who can no longer commit time to the project.
  * They are subject matter experts and may still contribute however cannot be assigned work from the PM.
* **Observers**
  * People who are interested in the project.
  * May still contribute however cannot be assigned work from the PM.

You can only be a contributor if you commit time to a project and are willing to be part of the team working together with the PM on tasks the project needs.

Anyone can work on any aspect of a project, even observers, but to be a contributor you must be willing to work on tasks that the team has jointly agreed upon and that the PM manages.

Observers are **not listed on the project's public webpage**.

Some projects will have contributors that volunteer their time, some projects will have contributors who have been allocated to work on a project by their organization.

## Project Reviews

### Community Project Reviews

* Working Group meetings are structured around project reviews.
* The primary purpose of a Working Group call is to discuss existing and upcoming projects.
* A representative of each project MUST be on the call, ideally the PM or the Lead Contributor.
* Each project has some time set aside to discuss plans, progress and problems related to the project.
* This is an opportunity for the Working Group to receive an update on the progress and for members to see if there are opportunities to volunteer.
* Working Groups should set aside some time to discuss new projects.

### GSF Weekly Project Reviews

* Every PM takes part in a weekly project review call with the other GSF PMs.
* In these GSF PM only calls PMs raise problems and we discuss solutions as a group.
* The main purpose of the call is to surface whether projects are going to hit or miss milestones, this is the main method we use to identify the health of a project.

### GSF Quarterly Reviews

Every quarter the GSF PMs prepare for a quarterly review, this is a more in depth meeting where each project is discussed at a higher level:

* Does the project still support the GSFs broader mission and theory of change?
* Comparing the project to the original PR FAQ, is it aligned or has it drifted?
* Review of the milestones and dates.
* Review team members, reward members who have contributed with a contributor or principal contributor title. Thank members who have contributed but cannot commit time any longer and add them to the advisors list.
* Hold elections for the lead contributor role, only contributors and advisors can hold that position and vote for that position. We assume everyone is happy with the current lead and only hold elections if someone wants to nominate themselves or members have commented that they would like to consider a new lead. This is more an opportunity for a change rather than forcing a change.
* Look at the project's public webpage, are there any updates needed there?

## Project Stages

There are 6 stages to every project (this is simplified from the full approach suggested by Linux Foundation).

**Pre-Draft**: A _proposed_ project with a PR-FAQ. Proposed projects are discussed in Working Group calls and asynchronously via GitHub comments/issues.

**Draft**: If the WG decided a PR-FAQ deserves further investigation they can mark it as Draft at which point the project lead works with a GSF PM to define milestones, project plans and an understanding of the resource requirements of the project.

**Live**: If the WG agrees and the project is staffed with enough contributors the project moves into Live. It is now considered to be an official GSF project, has resources assigned and a public website and repository is created.

**Approved**: The WG agrees the project (or version of a project)  has met its scope and something can be published.

**Ratification**: The chair(s) and project lead(s) present the project to the Steering Committee for ratification. _(This is only required for projects that are worked on via consensus)_

**Publication**: The Steering Committee approves and the communications team works on publication. _(This is only required for projects that are worked on via consensus)_

## Launching, changing and closing projects

### Launching a project

Any member may propose the launching of a project.

Launching a project needs consensus agreement, or a supermajority vote, by the Working Group the project is associated with.

The process to launch a project in GSF is:

1. Create a pull request to add a PR-FAQ in the dev branch of the pr-faq repository. There is advice regarding how to write PR-FAQs and other examples you can follow. If you don't understand how to create pull requests you can reach out to helpdesk@greensoftware.foundation and we can you.
2. Ask the relevant Working Group Chairs to be put on the agenda in next Working Group meetings to discuss your PR-FAQ. You might also benefit from adding them into the discussion of the PR-FAQ on GitHub by tagging them or asking them to review your pull request.
3. The Working Group deliberates, they may ask for changes to the PR-FAQ if they agree to the project in principle they will approve the pull request and the PR-FAQ will be visible in the dev branch of the pr-faq repository. This will move the project to the Pre-Draft stage and a GSF PM can be requested to work with you to flesh out your PR-FAQ into milestones, resources and a project plan.
4. When ready, create a pull-request from dev to main in the pr-faq repository and present the full plan with the GSF PM to the Working Group. If the Working Group agrees AND enough resources can be found to support the project the chair will accept the pull request and the project becomes live.the GSF PM will work with you to give you access to the resources you need to complete your project.

### Changing a project

Any member may propose a change to any project, even after the project has been launched.

All changes related to a project require consensus agreement, or a supermajority vote, by the Working Group the project is associated with and should be discussed with the Working Group chair.

### Closing a project

Any member may propose the closing of a project, even one not involved in the project themselves.

Closing a project needs consensus agreement, or a supermajority vote, by its Working Group.

The project team will work with the GSF PM and Chairperson to identify a method of gracefully closing the project down that doesnâ€™t adversely affect the reputation of the GSF and reduce trust in the other projects. This _may_ mean some form of reduced continued support.

## Project Types

There are multiple types of projects we can work on in the working groups. Each type of project will have a specific method of working. The two broad categories are **Consensus based**, e.g. standards, and **Maintainer based**, e.g. open source software.

**Maintainer-based** projects typically follow a meritocratic process where the Maintainer decides what changes to accept or reject. If a person doesn't like the decision that their contribution is rejected they can "fork" the project.

In **Consensus based** projects the goal is to reach interoperability; therefore, "forking" is not the solution to a dispute. The approval or rejection of a contribution follows a democratic process: the majority. If there is a sustainable objection in a contribution, the resolution is via a vote.

Projects in the Green Software Foundation should be clearly defined in their scope whether they are maintainer based or consensus based.

### Your project is consensus based if:

**Everyone needs to agree to one version of it for it to be a success.**

Does this need to be the gold standard, does this need to be adopted by all? Then follow a consensus based mode. For example, Standards need to be consensus based, multiple people creating slightly different versions of a standard is a failure.

One version of a white paper is success, anything where we are all agreeing on text of whatever form should most likely be consensus based.

### Your project is maintainer based if:

**There can be multiple different versions of the project and itâ€™s still a success.**

Can this project live with being forked? Can there exist multiple slightly different copies of it? Then consider following a maintainer-based model. For example, **open source** **software** projects may fall into this category.

## Consensus Based Projects

These projects are run via consensus with the same rules as the associated working group. If as an individual member you have concerns with the direction of these projects you may choose to raise an objection which needs to be resolved.

For example, projects related to creating whitepapers or specifications.

#### Owners

Only the Project Leadership Team have the right to accept or reject any changes.

#### How do you reach an agreement?

##### Discussion Phase

* People submit pull requests.
* There may be a discussion on the pull request.
* The pull request can be updated as a result of the discussion.

##### Review and Approval Phase

* At the decision of the chairs, the PR enters a Review & Approval (R&A) process for a period of time determined by the chair.
* The PR will be tagged with a label to indicate how much time there is for the R&A process.
  * 0 Days - Minor, Editorial Changes.
  * 1 or 2 Days for Minor Changes
  * 3 or 5 Days for Major Changes.
* If there are no **sustained objections** after that time period, the PR is merged.
* If there are objections, the person who made the objection needs to be made happy through reworking the pull request.
* If the person making the objection cannot be made happy there is a vote.

##### Consistency Review Phase

* To transition the **entire project** from the Live to the Approved state, it needs to be run through a consistency review process.
* This is a final chance for the whole WG to review the entire work product and will be the last chance to raise objections.
* All members of the WG have **14 days** to review and comment on the project prior to being Approved.
* If there are sustained objections at the end of 14 days the chairs may carry on trying to reach consensus or a vote can be held to move the project forward.

## Maintainer Based Projects

These projects are **not** run via consensus. Maintainers are selected to listen to feedback and incorporate it back into the project if they see fit to do so.

Despite not running via consensus, any individual member of the Foundation can raise objections to the project leads, working group chairs, or chairperson if they feel a maintainer of a project is not living up to the [values of the Green Software Foundation](#heading=h.995mlpivgci8) or is acting unfairly and without impartiality. In addition the Working Group can agree to change aspects of a project including changing the project lead.

For example, projects related to creating open source software or open data projects.

![drawing](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/12345/export/png)

#### Owners

One or more maintainers are assigned to the project by the project leads.

#### How do you reach an agreement?


###### Discussion Phase

* People submit pull requests.
* There may be a discussion on the pull request.
* The maintainers listen to feedback in the discussion process and can ask for PRs to be updated to meet the project's requirements or based on the discussion in the PR.
* Although forking is possible with these types of projects, all **reasonable means should be undertaken to avoid that outcome**.
* The maintainers have the ultimate authority to merge or reject PRs as they see fit.
* A member can appeal the rejection of their PR to the Project Leads, Chairs of the Working Group, or if there are conflicts of interest they can appeal directly to the Chairperson of the Foundation.

###### Consistency Review Phase

* To transition the **entire project** from the Live to the Approved state it needs to be run through a consistency review process.
* This is a final chance for the whole WG to review the entire work product and will be the last chance to raise objections and submit PRs.
* All members of the WG have **7 days** to review and comment on the project prior to being Approved.

## Trademark Protection for Projects

Trademarks are how we can both support open source software and creative commons copyright but also protect the Foundations reputation from derivations of our work that donâ€™t live up to our standards or the mission of the Foundation.

For some of the projects which people can fork we will use trademarks to protect them. For example, Kubernetes is a trademark. You **can** clone the Kubernetes repository, all the code, everything into another project and change it to be something else, thatâ€™s fine. You just canâ€™t call it Kubernetes anymore. In the open source world we use Trademarks to protect ourselves from people weakening our brand and reputation.

We have a Trademark Working Group and the support of the Linux Foundations legal department to register trademarks on our behalf.Roles & Responsibilities

## FAQ

## How do you propose projects?

* The very first stage of a project proposal is to create a PR FAQ.
* If itâ€™s a member driven project then this is shared with the WG to discuss and comment.
* If there is broad interest in the project then a PM works with the initiator to come up with a project document, identify key milestones and work backwards to a project plan.
* The project needs at least 3 contributors from two different orgs in order to go for a vote by the WG if approved the project goes ahead and is published on our website.

## Who can create projects?

Projects can be created by the GSF operations team or by members of the Foundation.

Some projects are essential to the running of the Foundation so are created and managed by the GSF operations team and donâ€™t need to go through a validation process.

Some projects are created by members of the Foundation and as such need to go through a validation and approval process via the relevant working group where that project will live.

## Who owns projects?

Projects are important to the GSF and have access to resources. In order to give projects the best chance of success the primary owner of every project is an **employee of GSF**, a product manager. The GSF PM is responsible for delivering the project, they will work with project members to help define the strategy, roadmap and milestones. They will assign work items to members and other GSF employees and track progress. Ultimately itâ€™s the GSF PM that is responsible for the execution of the project and meeting any deadlines.

## How do people communicate and collaborate on projects?

We use email lists and google groups to communicate on projects. Email is the best way to communicate since everyone has an email address and for some of our members use of slack and other communication tools is prohibited.

Every email list created in google groups allows you to view and comment on previous conversations and link to them online.

* **pr-&lt;name>** - Contains everyone. Visible in Google groups.
* **p-&lt;name>-lt** - just just the PM and the Lead Contributor (the leadership team) - Not visible in Google groups.

Email lists using Google Groups are also visible online as a forum so you can browse and link to historical messages like so: [https://groups.google.com/a/greensoftware.foundation/g/community-wg](https://groups.google.com/a/greensoftware.foundation/g/community-wg)

## How do we track projects?

* Every project has a PR FAQ that describes the key aspects of the project and is the first document people share to explain the project to others.
* Every project has milestones, defined deliverables that need to occur by a specific date. Projects are measured primarily against milestones.
* Projects may additionally define OKRs/KPIs or other methods to both communicate the purpose of the project and ensure over time itâ€™s meeting the objectives it was intended to resolve.
* Every project should have a public page on our website.

## What is a PR FAQ?

If someone asks what this project is about, the PR FAQ should be the first document they read.

This process was made famous by Amazon in their work backwards approach to project management. The first thing you write is a press release and a FAQ regarding the project and then work backwards to figure out what needs to be done to meet the project goals.

A press release:

* Focuses on the user
* Address pain points
* Measures success
* Considers stakeholders
* Sets a vision
* Is a story

This is a template press release: The FAQ should just be added to the end as a series of questions and answers.

You might start on the FAQ and then write the PR or vice versa.

## Where should project docs live in Google Drive?

All GSF Projects should have a subfolder under the GSF > [GSF Projects](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GfWTo6ybc9m6XpJkiAqSyVjbfiihpB-l?usp=sharing) folder and all the docs related to the project should be in that one folder.
