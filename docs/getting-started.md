# Getting Started

To get things started, could you complete this [onboarding form](https://greensoftware.foundation/onboarding/), which'll allow us to provide you access to all the right areas, and your profile to our web pages.



1. üìñ  Read our [Manifesto](https://greensoftware.foundation/manifesto). 

This defines our mission and vision as well as our values. It‚Äôs the most important document you will read.



2. üìñ Read [What is Green Software](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/what-is-green-software)?

This article explains our definition of Green software.



3. üìñ Read [How we work?](https://greensoftware.foundation/articles/welcome-to-the-green-software-foundation)

This article explains how the Foundation is structured and how we make decisions.



4. üëã  Say Hello

Please join our Slack and introduce yourself in the[ #introductions](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgreensoftware-zzk1035.slack.com%2Farchives%2FC023N44UGN8&data=04%7C01%7CAsim.Hussain%40microsoft.com%7C4d82df08530544487f5c08d955ad382f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637635026083030844%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&sdata=MF4qSmxH4I8cc550xxg7x4G1TN2sHcUiuLREV%2Bwwfa8%3D&reserved=0) channel. We would love to hear a bit about you and your motivations. If you don't have access to Slack yet, please contact helpdesk@greensoftware.foundation



5. üåç  Join your regional channels

We have Slack channels for different regions, join the ones that make the most sense for you, e.g. #local-emea, #local-americas, #local-apac and other more specific channels for countries and cities will be created if there is enough interest.



6. ü§î Make sure you have access to our Google drive.

Click this link, your organization's email should have access. If your organization's email is a Google Workspace email then you should have no problem accessing our Google Drive. If your organization's email is NOT a Google Workspace email then you may be struggling. The solution is to create a **shadow Google identity** with your organisation's email address. [More instructions](#heading=h.e0ytvd1ce8ts) can be found later on in this handbook. 

 



7. ü§ù  Look for projects to join

Each project maintains a list of the tasks where they are looking for help, please take a look [here](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+user%3AGreen-Software-Foundation+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+), if one of those tasks speaks to you then follow the instructions for how to help.

Or just browse the current list of official [GSF projects](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects) and see if any interest you. If they do, read the project doc and contact the project chairs for more info. 

Each project is associated with a working group. To participate in a project, you must be a member of the associated working group.



8. ü§ù  Join Working Groups.

The Foundation functions as a set of smaller Working Groups (WG). Each with its own set of projects and scope. Your next task is to **decide which of these working groups you would like to be involved in**. A list of the [working groups](#heading=h.trlvmoyq7oly) and their scopes are below. The time commitment will be a few hours a month, _at least,_ for each Working Group. 

Please join working groups by filling out [this form](https://greensoftware.foundation/onboarding/).



9. üëÄ  Review welcome email from working groups and follow their getting started guides.

You will be sent a welcome email for each working group you have joined with instructions specific to that group, including who they are, what projects they are working on and how to get involved. Be on the lookout for that email and follow their getting started guides.
