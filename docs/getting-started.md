4. üëã  Say Hello

Consider joining our Slack and introducing yourself in the [#introductions](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgreensoftware-zzk1035.slack.com%2Farchives%2FC023N44UGN8&data=04%7C01%7CAsim.Hussain%40microsoft.com%7C4d82df08530544487f5c08d955ad382f%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637635026083030844%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C2000&sdata=MF4qSmxH4I8cc550xxg7x4G1TN2sHcUiuLREV%2Bwwfa8%3D&reserved=0) channel. We would love to hear a bit about you and your motivations. If you don't have access to Slack yet, please contact helpdesk@greensoftware.foundation

5. ü§î Make sure you have access to our Google drive.

Click this link, your organization's email should have access. If your organization's email is a Google Workspace email then you should have no problem accessing our Google Drive. If your organization's email is NOT a Google Workspace email then you may be struggling. The solution is to create a **shadow Google identity** with your organization's email address. [More instructions](troubleshooting.md)) can be found in the troubleshooting section.

6. ü§ù  Look for projects to join

Browse the current list of official [GSF projects](https://greensoftware.foundation/projects) and see if any interest you. If they do, read the project doc and contact the project leads for more info.

Each project is associated with a working group. To participate in a project, you must be a member of the associated working group.

To be a member of the project team, take part in elections and be listed on the project website you **must** be willing to commit **at least** 2hrs a week to the project and have tasks assigned to you by the project PM. Projects also have an observer status, you can follow their progress, chime in on discussions but you won't be considered a member of the project team.

7. ü§ù  Join Working Groups.

The Foundation functions as a set of smaller Working Groups (WG). Each with its own set of projects and scope. Your next task is to **decide which of these working groups you would like to be involved in**. This is a list of the [working groups](working-groups.md)) and their scopes. T

Please join working groups by filling out [this form](https://greensoftware.foundation/onboarding/).

8. üëÄ  Review welcome email from working groups and follow their getting started guides.

You will be sent a welcome email for each working group you have joined with instructions specific to that group, including who they are, what projects they are working on and how to get involved. Be on the lookout for that email and follow their getting started guides.
